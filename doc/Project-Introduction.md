# Informatics Project "Simon Goes Multiplayer" - Summer Semester 2025

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Simon Goes Multiplayer" project, an engaging and challenging course project designed for students interested in Computer Science and Technical Informatics. This project aims to deepen understanding of embedded systems development, backend and frontend technologies, and the integration of various technological components.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a multiplayer version of the well-known memory game "Simon." All students will work in teams to implement all the different aspects of the game, including hardware prototypes, backend logic, frontend design, and network communications.

## Assignment Details

### Mandatory User Stories
Each team is required to implement a series of user stories that ensure the basic functionality of the simon game. These include developing a prototypical hardware controller experiment with buttons, LEDs and other periphery, implementing game logic in the backend, designing a user interface in the frontend, and ensuring network communication between the various game components. Detailed requirements and sub-tasks are specified in the project repository.

### Additional User Stories
To further encourage creativity and technical excellence, all teams may implement additional, optional user stories. These extended features offer you the opportunity to earn extra points and compensate for any shortcomings in the implementation of mandatory user stories. The optional user stories are designed to challenge you and allow you to showcase your skills and creativity.

## Evaluation Criteria

Project evaluation will be based on successful implementation of mandatory user stories, code quality, functionality of implemented features, and creative use of optional user stories to enhance the overall project. Special emphasis will be placed on the quality of documentation, system robustness, and user-friendliness of the application.

## Final Presentation

At the conclusion of the project, each team will present their solution in a showcase that demonstrates the game's functionality and discusses the technical challenges and achievements encountered. This presentation is an excellent opportunity to reflect on your work and present your results.
